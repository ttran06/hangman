# Hangman

The Hangman program aims to create a fun game targeting towards both native English speakers and English learners of all ages who would like to have some fun. Once the game starts, the user will be initially asked to choose one category of words from “food”, “animals”, “countries”, and “Pop culture”. Once the user clicks on the graphic images for categories, a random word from the corresponding category will then be selected and shown in dashes on the screen for the user to guess.

The user can guess by one single letter or by the whole word. As the hangman graphic generally has 7 body parts, the user will be given 7 chances to make guesses. Once the user have inputted a letter as an answer, the program will function to determine if the guess is correct. If it is right, the letter will be inserted into the dashes; if it is wrong, a letter will be thrown in the trash and a body part will be added to the hangman. The user automatically win the game if they guess the word right or lose the game if they haven’t figured out the word before the chances are used up.

A window of “lose” or “win” will show up on the screen at the end of the game, and the user is more than welcome to play the game over and over again!
